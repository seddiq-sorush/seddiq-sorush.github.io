## Overview

This step-by-step tutorial is a beginner-friendly introduction to connecting your Node backend application to a PostgreSQL database and leveraging Knex.js, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
## Tech Stack: 
Below, I'll explain the technologies used in this tutorial. Feel free to skip this section if you're already familiar with these tools.

- **Node** — A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. The key takeaway is that we can write server-side JavaScript to create full-stack applications entirely in JavaScript.

- **npm** — Included with Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager) is a robust tool for managing dependencies, tracking publicly available code packages, and specifying package versions.

- **Express** — A web development framework for handling HTTP requests and responses in Node.js. It makes it easier to create APIs and manage routing.

- **Knex.js** — A query builder and ORM for Node.js that allows you to interact with your SQL database in a more structured, JavaScript-friendly way.

- **PostgreSQL** — A powerful relational database management system that will store your data. While MongoDB is also commonly paired with Node, PostgreSQL is a great choice for structured data storage.

- **Docker** - A platform for running containerized applications, which helps isolate dependencies and ensure consistency across environments.

## Initial Setup
To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need to install the following technologies. Most of these installations are done via the terminal command line and should work fine on macOS, Linux, or Windows (using cmd or PowerShell).
#### Node
The easiest way to install Node.js is by using[NVM(Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Alternatively, you can download and install Node.js from the  [Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en).
```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
# OR using wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```
Make sure to add NVM to your environment variables (note: Windows installation can be a bit tricky):
```shell
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

After installing, verify that NVM is correctly installed:
```shell
nvm -v
# OR
nvm --version
# Expected out: 0.40.1 or another version number
```
Now, install Node.js using NVM. The good thing about NVM is that it allows you to have `multiple versions` of Node installed and switch between them as needed.
```shell
nvm install node # OR
nvm install --lts # This will install the latest LTS version

# To install a specific version of Node, use `nvm ls-remote` to list remote versions
nvm ls-remote # 
# OR
nvm ls-remote --lts #Will list only the latest LTS versions
nvm install 18.1.0

# To see the versions of Node installed on your machine and switch to a different version:
nvm ls
nvm use <version>
```
Once Node is installed, you can confirm the installation by checking the version:
```shell
node -v
```

#### Docker
The easiest way to use Docker is to install [Docker Desktop ](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Free for personal use). Alternatively, you can install docker via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on macOS)
```shell
# # To install Homebrew (if not already installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Update Homebrew
brew update
# Install Docker
brew install --cask docker
# Verify that Docker is installed
docker --version # Expected output: Docker version 27.0.3, build 7d4bcd8
# To Open Docker
open /Applications/Docker.app
```
### Run PostgreSQL
With Docker up and running, we can now pull the official PostgreSQL Docker image and run it on your machine.

Pull the PostgreSQL Docker image: Use the following command to pull the latest PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub:

```shell
docker pull postgres
```
Run the PostgreSQL container: To start a PostgreSQL container, run the following command. This will create a new PostgreSQL instance running inside a container:

```shell
docker run --name postgres-container -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

`--name postgres-container` gives the container a name. <br/>
`-e POSTGRES_USER=myuser` sets the username for the PostgreSQL instance. <br/>
`-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword` sets the password for the PostgreSQL user.<br/>
`-e POSTGRES_DB=mydb` sets the name of the database to create.<br/>
`-p 5432:5432` maps port 5432 on the container to port 5432 on your machine (default PostgreSQL port).<br/>
`-d postgres` runs the container in detached mode, so it runs in the background.<br/>

Verify the container is running: To check if the PostgreSQL container is running correctly, use:
```shell
docker ps
#You should see an entry for postgres-container in the list of running containers.
```

Access the PostgreSQL container: You can access the running PostgreSQL container by executing the following command:

```shell
docker exec -it postgres-container psql -U myuser -d mydb # you need to enter your password (in our case `mypassword`)
```
This command opens an interactive terminal inside the container and connects to the mydb database using the myuser credentials.

#### Postman
To test our APIs we'll use Postman [Downlaod from Official Website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)


## Node Project Setup
Now that we have Node and npm set up, let's create a simple Node.js project using Express and set up automatic server reload with nodemon.

**1. Navigate to your project folder**: Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to store your project. You can also open the folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., VSCode):
```shell
cd /path/to/your/project/folder

# If you prefer using an IDE like VSCode, you can open the folder directly:
code /path/to/your/project/folder
```

**2. Initialize the project**: Once you’re in your project folder, run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a package.json file with default values.
```shell
npm init -y
```
**3. Install Required Dependencies**: Install the essential dependencies for your project:

- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Knex.js**: SQL query builder for interacting with your database.
- **pg**: PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
- **dotenv**: To load environment variables (configurations)
- **cors**: Middleware to enable [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
Run this command to install them:
```shell
npm install express knex pg dotenv cors
```
Additionally, install `nodemon` as a development dependency for automatically restarting the server whenever you make changes:
```shell
npm install -D nodemon
```
**4. Update package.json Scripts**: In your `package.json` file, you’ll see a section for `scripts`. Add a `dev` script to run your application with `nodemon`, like this:
```json
{
  "name": "knex-tutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js" // you need to update this
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.1",
    "knex": "^3.1.0",
    "pg": "^8.13.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.7"
  }
}
```
**5. Create the `index.js` File**: Now, create the index.js file in your project folder and add the following code to set up a basic Express server:
```javascript
// Import express
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors')

// Create an express app
const app = express();
app.use(cors()); // you can allow specific origins (domains)

// Define the port the server will run on
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```
**6. Run the Application**: To run the server with nodemon, use the following command:
```shell
npm run dev
```
You should see the following output:
```shell
> knex-tutorial@1.0.0 dev
> nodemon index.js

[nodemon] 3.1.7
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,cjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Server is running on port 3000
```
**7. Test Your Server**: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should see your server running and able to respond to requests.

## Knex Configuration
Now that our server is up and running, it’s time to integrate the database. Knex.js offers a great deal of flexibility when it comes to interacting with databases. You can use Knex in a code-first approach to design your database schema, create tables, seed data, and handle database transactions. Additionally, Knex allows you to configure different database environments (development, staging, production) with ease.

**1. Install Knex Globally**: To get started with Knex, you’ll first need to install it globally on your machine. This will allow you to use Knex’s CLI tools for database migrations, seeding, and more.
Run the following command to install `Knex globally`:
```shell
npm install -g knex
```
**2. Verify Installation**: Once the installation is complete, verify that Knex was installed correctly by checking its version:
```shell
knex --version
```
The output should look something like this:
```shell
Knex CLI version: 3.1.0
Knex Local version: 3.1.0
```
**3. Knex for Database Management**: Knex simplifies working with databases in a programmatic manner, making it easier to manage schemas, data migrations, and seed files. Here are some key features Knex provides:

- `Code-first Database Design`: You can define and manage your tables and relationships through JavaScript code instead of manually writing SQL.
- `Migrations`: You can create version-controlled migrations that help you track changes to your database schema over time.
- `Seeding`: Easily seed data into your database for testing or initial setup.
- `Environment-Specific Configuration`: Knex allows you to set up different configurations for development, staging, and production environments, ensuring that your app works correctly across different environments.

## Database Configuration
To start the database integration with your node application. creating the `knexfile` is essential. The knexfile contains configuration settings for connecting to your database, including different environments like `development`, `staging`, and `production`.
To create `knexfile` you can run the following and it will create the `knexfile.js` fo you:

```shell
knex init
```
**2. Configure the `knexfile.js` for Different Environments**: Open the knexfile.js and configure it as follows:
```javascript
// Update with your config settings.

/**
 * @type { Object.<string, import("knex").Knex.Config> }
 */
module.exports = {

  development: {
    client: 'sqlite3',
    connection: {
      filename: './dev.sqlite3'
    }
  },

  staging: {
    client: 'postgresql',
    connection: {
      database: 'my_db',
      user:     'username',
      password: 'password'
    },
    pool: {
      min: 2,
      max: 10
    },
    migrations: {
      tableName: 'knex_migrations'
    }
  },

  production: {
    client: 'postgresql',
    connection: {
      database: 'my_db',
      user:     'username',
      password: 'password'
    },
    pool: {
      min: 2,
      max: 10
    },
    migrations: {
      tableName: 'knex_migrations'
    }
  }

};
```


Since we're in development mode, let's update the development configurations:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config(); // <-- Update this

/**
 * @type { Object.<string, import("knex").Knex.Config> }
 */
module.exports = {

  development: {
    client: 'pg', // we use `pg`(https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) as client
    connection: {
      database: process.env.DB_NAME ,
      user:     process.env.DB_USER ,
      password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
      host: process.env.DB_HOST,
      port: process.env.DB_PORT
    },
    migrations: {
      directory: "./data/migrations" // make sure to create data/migrations folder
    },
    seeds: { directory: "./data/seeds", timestampFilenamePrefix: true } // make sure to create data/seeds folder
  },

  // ... rest of the code

};
```
**NOTE:** Make sure to add the following configuration in your `.env` file:
```
DB_NAME=my_db
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```


### Creating tables
We now use the `Knex` [Migration CLI](https://knexjs.org/guide/migrations.html#migration-cli) to create our database tables. Make sure you run the following commands from the root directory of your project.

```shell
knex migrate:make users # knex migrate: make table_name
```
The command above will generate a migration file (the code to create a table in the database) and place it in the `data/migrations` folder.
![Migration](~/assets/images/blog-images/node-express-knex-postgres/migration.png)
The Migration file contains two methods. `up` and `down`.

```javascript
/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
exports.up = function(knex) {
  
};

/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
exports.down = function(knex) {
  
};
```
1. **`up` Method**:
  - The up method is used to apply changes to the database `schema`, such as `creating tables`, `adding columns`, `modifying columns`, or `creating indexes`.
  - It's called when we run `knex migrate:latest`, which applies all the pending migrations.
  - Think of up as the process of **applying changes**.
2. **`down` Method**:
  - The down method defines how to `undo` the changes made in the up method. This is typically used for rolling back a migration.
  - It's called when you run `knex migrate:rollback`, which undoes the most recent migration.
  - Think of down as the process of `reversing or rolling back` changes.

Now let's makes the changes to our `users` table:
```javascript
/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
exports.up = function(knex) {
    return knex.schema.createTable('users', function(table) {
        table.increments('id').primary();
        table.string('name');
        table.string('email').unique();
        table.timestamps(); 
      });
};

/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
exports.down = function(knex) {
  return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists('users');
};
```
**NOTE:** `table.timestamps()` will create two table columns, `created_at` and `updated_at`
Similarly, we can create the `posts` table:
```shell
knex migrate:make posts
```
```javascript
/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
exports.up = function (knex) {
    return knex.schema.createTable('posts', function (table) {
        table.increments('id').primary();
        table.integer('created_by');
        table.foreign('created_by').references('id').inTable('users');
        table.string('title');
        table.text('content');
        table.timestamps();
    });
};

/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
exports.down = function (knex) {
    return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists('posts');
};
```
**NOTE:** in the above `posts` migration file, we've established a relationship between the `posts` table and the `users` tables. `Knex` provides a variety of useful methods to handle such operations efficiently. 
Now, let's run our migrations. This will create the respective tables in the database along with their relationships.
```shell
knex migrate:latest
```
This will create four tables: two for tracking migrations and the other two are `users` and `posts` tables.
![Migration](~/assets/images/blog-images/node-express-knex-postgres/migrate-latest.png)
A few other Migration commands:
| Command                          | Description                                                             |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `knex migrate:make <name>`       | Creates a new migration file.                                           |
| `knex migrate:latest`            | Runs all pending migrations.                                            |
| `knex migrate:latest --env production`            | Runs all pending migrations for production env.        |
| `knex migrate:rollback`          | Rolls back the most recent batch of migrations.                         |
| `knex migrate:rollback --all`          | Rolls back all the completed migrations                           | 
| `knex migrate:status`            | Shows the status of all migrations (applied or pending).                |
| `knex migrate:currentVersion`    | Shows the version of the most recent applied migration.                 |
| `knex migrate:up`    | To run the next migration that has not yet been run.                                |
| `knex migrate:up <migration.js>`    | To run a specific migration by name.                                 |
| `knex migrate:down <migration.js>`  | Manually rolls back a specific migration by name.                    |

## Seeding data
Now that we have created our tables, let's **seed** (insert data into) them with fake data. Seeding data is typically done to test the application and ensure it behaves as expected with realistic inputs.
To accomplish this, we can use `knex seed` to insert data into our tables. Similar to migrations, Knex also provides a [Seed CLI](https://knexjs.org/guide/migrations.html#seed-cli) to help with seeding operations.

```shell
knex seed:make users # knex seed:make seed_name
```
The command above will generate a seed file, which contains the code to insert data into the database, and place it in the `data/seeds` folder.

![Seed](~/assets/images/blog-images/node-express-knex-postgres/seed.png)

The seed file includes a `seed` method that will populate the database with data when executed.

To seed fake data, let's install [faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) package:
```shell
npm install --save-dev @faker-js/faker
```

Now, let's add `100` fake users into our `users` table:

```javascript
const { faker } = require('@faker-js/faker');

/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> } 
 */
exports.seed = async function (knex) {
  // Deletes ALL existing entries
  await knex('users').del()

  const users = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    const user = {
      name: faker.person.fullName(),
      email: faker.internet.email(),
      created_at: faker.date.anytime(),
      updated_at: faker.date.anytime(),
    };

    users.push(user);
  }
  await knex('users').insert(users);
};
```

To insert fake data into the database, you can run the following:
```shell
knex seed:run 
```
The command above will run all the seed files located in the `data/seeds` folder. However, if you want to run a specific seed file, you can do so as follows:
```shell
knex seed:run --specific=seed-filename.js --specific=another-seed-filename.js
```
Seeding data into the `posts` table can be a little tricky because we have a `foreign key` relationship with the `users` table. First, we need to select user IDs from the `users` table and then randomly assign a post to a user. To select the `id` column from the `users` table, we can use the `pluck` method in Knex, and then use `Math.random()` to select a random ID. Here’s the complete code for the `posts` seed file:

```javascript
const { faker } = require('@faker-js/faker');

const getColumnData = async (knex, tableName, columnName) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    knex(tableName).pluck(columnName).then(async (columnData) => {
      resolve(columnData);
    });
  })
}


/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> } 
 */
exports.seed = async function (knex) {
  // Deletes ALL existing entries
  await knex('posts').del()

  const userIds = await getColumnData(knex, "users", "id");

  const posts = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    const randomUser = Math.floor(Math.random() * userIds.length);
    const randomUserId = userIds[randomUser];

    const post = {
      title: faker.lorem.sentence(),
      content: faker.lorem.paragraphs(4),
      created_by: randomUserId,
      created_at: faker.date.anytime(),
      updated_at: faker.date.anytime(),
    }
    posts.push(post);
  }

  await knex('posts').insert(posts);
};

```
Since we've already run the `users` seed file, this time we only need to run the `posts` seed file. You can do it like this:

```shell
knex seed:run --specific=20241211204745_posts.js
```

Seed Commands:
| Command                              | Description                                                              |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `knex seed:make <name>`              | Creates a new seed file.                                                 |
| `knex seed:run`                      | Runs all seed files to populate the database with data.                  |
| `knex seed:run --specific=<name>`    | Runs a specific seed file by name.                                       |
| `knex seed:run --directory=<path>`   | Runs seed files from a specific directory.                               |                        |
| `knex seed:run --quiet`              | Suppresses output while running the seed files.                          |


## Creating Routes
It is the time to create our API routes to perform CRUD operations.
